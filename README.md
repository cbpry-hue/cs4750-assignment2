### Generative AI used: 
#### GitHub Copilot
Used to include needed libraries and also was very handy for comments as I wrote the code. Might have gone a little overboard on the comments.
I find it annoying for actuall code suggestions since when using Codespaces it insists on inserting the code suggesting into you existing code and doesn't let you pick and choose what you want to implement. I'm oldschool and don't like people/"AI" touching my code.

#### Google Gemini
Uploaded all of the project spec files to the chat.
Periodicly uploaded a copy of the code I had so far to get suggestions on changes if I was straying from the project parameters or on what I needed to address next.
Example: Uploaded right after coding the clock and before I initiated it in main. It reminded me to initiate it and gave me a suggestion of how to do so.
 - format the final printf for the "Combined Time" report in oss.c to ensure the seconds and nanoseconds align with the example in the instructions
  - format the final printf for the report in worker.c to ensure it meets the guidlines

I like Gemini best currently of the AI models that I have tried so far. It does a better job of presenting info in a clean formate that is geared more toward you understanding why it suggested the changes it suggested where GitHub Copilot tends to just throw code at you and fails to backup it's suggestions expecting you to already know what the answer to your own question.
